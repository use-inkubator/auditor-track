# ink!ubator: Auditor Track

The ink!ubator's Auditor Track is intended to be a way to introduce experienced auditors
in other smart contract ecosystems to ink! and `pallet-contracts` with the ultimate goal
of helping bootstrap a self-sufficient auditing ecosystem.

For the other tracks of the ink!ubator see the
[full bounty proposal](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/bounty/19).

## Open Questions
- What risks are auditing teams concerned with when entering a new ecosystem?
    - What are ways we can help out in mitigating them?
- What do we need to provide in terms of educational materials and technical support to
  get auditing teams up to speed with ink! and `pallet-contracts`?
- What deliverables can we have the auditing teams produce which will: help reinforce the
  concepts they're learning, as well as produce a basin of knowledge for the
  ink!cosystem.
- What can we do to help set teams up for sustainable businesses around auditing in the
  ink! ecosystem?

## Goals
- Teach experienced smart contract auditors about ink! and `pallet-contracts`
- Provide non-trivial, low-stakes code for auditors to get familiar with the ecosystem
    - Done through the Builder and Grant tracks
- Provide funding to auditors to ensure that their entry into the ecosystem is
  financially viable
- Produce a basin of knowledge around smart contract security for the community

## Non-Goals
- To be a bootcamp for non-auditors to become auditors
    - The funding allocated towards something like this could shift in the future, but as
      it stands we only want experienced auditors coming through

## Success Metrics
By the end of 2023 we should have:
- Two teams which are technically capable to audit production grade smart contracts
- Publicly accessible learning resources around security in ink!
    - E.g: A web search for "ink contract security best practices" should return blogs,
      videos, etc.

## Relation to Builder and Grants Tracks
- Auditors will provide reviews or audits to teams going through the Builder and Grant
  tracks

## Funding Available
- Around $500k USD for the first cohort
- This may be for audits of the Builder and Grants tracks, as well as for audit related
  activities
    - Audit related activities could be: building tooling or producing educational
      materials
- Rough Breakdown:
    - $50k-100k per Builder Track Team (x2)
    - $50k-100k per Grants Track Team (x5)
    - Spend of $75k/project * 7 projects = $525k

## Track Overview
- Pick one or two teams to join the auditor track
- Work closely with the teams to get them up to speed with ink! and `pallet-contracts`
    - Concurrently, audit teams should produce security related materials which can be
      beneficial to the ecosystem
    - Concurrently, teams in the Builder and Grants tracks are working on contracts
- Once Builder and Grant contracts are ready, an auditor team (or maybe both, depending
  on funding available) from the cohort will review contracts
    - Auditor teams share their review reports publicly

## Timelines (2023)
- End of March: ink!ubator website live
    - Marketing campaign can begin
- Early/Mid April: Review applications for Builder and Grant tracks
- Mid/Late April: Start working with Builder and Grant teams
    - Concurrently, start working with auditors to get them up to speed with ink!
- June/July/August: Builder and Grant teams have contracts which are ready for review
    - Concurrently: Auditor teams start reviewing contracts
