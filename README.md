# ink!ubator: Auditor Track

The ink!ubator's Auditor Track is an initiative designed to introduce experienced
auditors in other smart contract ecosystems to ink! and `pallet-contracts` with the
ultimate goal of helping bootstrap a self-sufficient auditing ecosystem.

The Auditor Track is part of the **ink!ubator**, a holistic bounty program with the goal
of furthering the ink! smart contracting ecosystem. This bounty program is funded by the
Polkadot treasury with the support of the community.

The bounty includes Curators from the following Polkadot ecosystem teams:
- [Astar Network](https://astar.network/)
- [Parity](https://www.parity.io/)
- [Phala Network](https://www.phala.network/en/)
- [Brushfam](https://brushfam.io/)
- [Aleph Zero](https://alephzero.org/)

The Auditor Track is only one aspect of the ink!ubator. For more details on the rest of
the initiative see the
[Polkadot Treasury Bounty Proposal](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/bounty/19).

## Open Questions
- What risks are auditing teams concerned with when entering a new ecosystem?
    - What are ways we can help out in mitigating them?
- What do we need to provide in terms of educational materials and technical support to
  get auditing teams up to speed with ink! and `pallet-contracts`?
- What deliverables can we have the auditing teams produce which will: help reinforce the
  concepts they're learning, as well as produce a basin of knowledge for the
  ink!cosystem.
- What can we do to help set teams up for sustainable businesses around auditing in the
  ink! ecosystem?

## Goals
- Teach experienced smart contract auditors about ink! and `pallet-contracts`
- Provide non-trivial, low-stakes code for auditors to get familiar with the ecosystem
    - Done through the Builder and Grant tracks
- Provide funding to auditors to ensure that their entry into the ecosystem is
  financially viable
- Produce a basin of knowledge around smart contract security for the community

## Non-Goals
- To be a bootcamp for non-auditors to become auditors
    - The funding allocated towards something like this could shift in the future, but as
      it stands we only want experienced auditors coming through

## Track Overview
- Teams apply to become part of the Auditor Track
- The Curators will pick one or two teams to join
- Developers from Curator-affiliated teams will work closely with auditing teams to get
  them up to speed with ink! and `pallet-contracts`
    - Concurrently, audit teams should produce security related materials which can be
      beneficial to the ecosystem
    - Concurrently, teams in the Builder and Grants tracks are working on contracts
- Once Builder and Grant contracts are ready, an auditor team (or maybe both, depending
  on funding available) from the cohort will review contracts
- Auditor teams share their review reports publicly

## Expectations for Participants
- Teams will be expected to create educational content related to smart contract security
    - The medium is flexible, as long as it's free, accessible, and high quality
- Teams will be expected to perform code reviews and auditors for teams in other tracks
  of the ink!ubator
    - Any learnings and findings should be made public

## Relation to Builder and Grants Tracks
- Auditors will provide reviews or audits to teams going through the Builder and Grant
  tracks

## Success Metrics
By the end of 2023 we should have:
- Two teams which are technically capable to audit production grade smart contracts
- Publicly accessible learning resources around security in ink!
    - E.g: A web search for "ink contract security best practices" should return blogs,
      videos, etc.

## Funding Available
- Around $500k USD for the first cohort
- This may be for audits of the Builder and Grants tracks, as well as for audit related
  activities
    - Audit related activities could be: building tooling or producing educational
      materials
- Rough Breakdown:
    - $50k-100k per Builder Track Team (x2)
    - $50k-100k per Grants Track Team (x5)
    - Spend of $75k/project * 7 projects = $525k

## Timelines (2023)
- End of March: ink!ubator website live
    - Marketing campaign can begin
- Early/Mid April: Review applications for Builder and Grant tracks
- Mid/Late April: Start working with Builder and Grant teams
    - Concurrently, start working with auditors to get them up to speed with ink!
- June/July/August: Builder and Grant teams have contracts which are ready for review
    - Concurrently: Auditor teams start reviewing contracts
